# AI-snake
A ai-snake without longest path algorithm<br>
the code uses the ncurses.h and unicode, so remember to add -lncursesw when compile.<br>
the code uses the random dfs to avoid the shortest path algorithm and not guaranteed to fill up the map.<br>
you can increase the 'speed' to slow down the snake.<br>
